question: According to Nobel Prize winner F.A Hayek, what must happen to have good money again?

wrong_answers:
  - We give the thing to a better government.
  - We give the thing to an authoritarian government.
  - We take the thing out of the hands of the people.
explanation: |
  Hayek says: "I don't believe that we should ever have a good money again, before we take the thing out of the hands of the government. If we can't take them violently out of the hands of the government, all we can do is by some sly or roundabout way introduce something they can't stop."
