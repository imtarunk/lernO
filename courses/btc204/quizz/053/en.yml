question: What is the purpose of Labels in Silent Payments?

answer: To use multiple different static addresses without unreasonably increasing the scanning workload.

wrong_answers:
  - To encrypt Silent Payments transactions to hide the real recipient of the transaction.
  - To use multiple different static addresses that cannot be linked by an external observer.
  - To place a visible label on the blockchain to identify Silent Payments in the manner of a payment reference.

explanation: |
  Labels are used to generate multiple static addresses from the main static address, which facilitates wallet organization. However, an external observer could easily establish a link between these labeled static addresses, since the scan public key is the same for all.
