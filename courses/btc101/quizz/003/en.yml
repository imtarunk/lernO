question: Why do we pay fees in Bitcoin?
answer: To create a free market for including transactions in blocks.
wrong_answers:
  - To introduce how to mine Bitcoin.
  - To let rich people pay more.
  - To exclude governments from the network.
explanation: |
  Fees are essential to create a free market for including transactions in blocks. In fact, a block has a size of 1 MB (which was expanded to 4MB after the Segwit update), so the number of transactions that can be "inserted" in a block is limited to a few thousand transactions per block.
