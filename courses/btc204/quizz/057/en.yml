question: What is the main threat associated with address reuse?

answer: It allows for deterministic links to be established between different transactions and a common ownership of the concerned UTXOs.

wrong_answers:
  - It exposes the user's IP address to other network participants during transaction validation.
  - It reduces the effectiveness of digital signature mechanisms, which weakens the security of transactions.
  - It leads to an increase in transaction fees due to congestion caused by address reuse.

explanation: |
  If the same address is used for multiple transactions, it becomes possible to deduce that all bitcoins associated with that address belong to the same person.
